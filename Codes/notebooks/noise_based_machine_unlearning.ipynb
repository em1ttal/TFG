        "# Noise-Based Machine Unlearning Methods for Tabular Data\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📚 What is Machine Unlearning?\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine unlearning is the process of making a trained model \"forget\" specific data points, as if they were never part of the training set. This is crucial for:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\" requires deletion of user data\n",
        "- **Data Corrections**: Removing mislabeled or corrupted training samples\n",
        "- **Bias Mitigation**: Eliminating problematic data that causes unfair predictions\n",
        "- **Security**: Preventing memorization of sensitive information\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Challenge**: Simply deleting data isn't enough—the model has already learned from it! Retraining from scratch is expensive and often infeasible for large models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Solution**: Approximate unlearning methods that are much faster than retraining.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Noise-Based Unlearning: Core Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Insight**: Neural networks store learned information in their parameters (weights and biases). By carefully adding noise to these parameters, we can disrupt the specific patterns associated with the forget set while preserving general knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Noise Works**:\n",
        "- Small random perturbations break precise memorization\n",
        "- Model becomes less confident about specific forget set samples\n",
        "- General patterns (shared with retain set) are more robust to noise\n",
        "- Provides plausible deniability about forget set data\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔬 Methods Implemented:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Gaussian Noise Injection** \n",
        "   - **Approach**: Add N(0, σ²) noise uniformly to all parameters\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Simple, easy to tune, well-understood statistics\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Treats all parameters equally (may be inefficient)\n",
        "   - **Use case**: Baseline method, quick experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Laplacian Noise Injection**\n",
        "   - **Approach**: Add Laplace(0, b) noise to parameters\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Heavier tails → better for differential privacy guarantees\n",
        "   - **Cons**: More variable results, still uniform across parameters\n",
        "   - **Use case**: When formal privacy guarantees are needed\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Adaptive Noise Scaling**\n",
        "   - **Approach**: Scale noise based on gradient magnitude on forget set\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Targets important parameters, better trade-off between forgetting/retaining\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Requires forget set access, more computation\n",
        "   - **Use case**: When you want efficient, targeted unlearning\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Layer-wise Noise Injection**\n",
        "   - **Approach**: Apply different noise levels to different network layers\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Fine-grained control, can preserve low-level features\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Requires understanding of layer hierarchy\n",
        "   - **Use case**: When you know which layers are most responsible for memorization\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Gradient-based Noise**\n",
        "   - **Approach**: Noise magnitude directly proportional to gradient magnitude\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Extremely targeted, follows loss landscape\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Very sensitive to multiplier choice\n",
        "   - **Use case**: Maximum targeting efficiency, research comparisons\n",

        "## 📊 Evaluation Metrics:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Forget Set Accuracy** (↓ lower is better)\n",
        "   - How well the model still predicts the forget set\n",
        "   - Should decrease after successful unlearning\n",
        "   - Target: Approach performance on unseen data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Retain Set Accuracy** (↑ higher is better)\n",
        "   - How well the model still predicts the retained training data\n",
        "   - Should remain high (minimal collateral damage)\n",
        "   - Target: Stay close to original model performance\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test Set Accuracy** (↑ higher is better)\n",
        "   - Overall model generalization performance\n",
        "   - Indicates if the model is still useful after unlearning\n",
        "   - Target: Maintain competitive accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Parameter Distance** (L2 norm)\n",
        "   - How much parameters changed from original model\n",
        "   - Helps understand aggressiveness of unlearning\n",
        "   - Larger distance = more aggressive modification\n",

        "## 10. Key Findings and Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding the Results:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Forget Set Accuracy**: Should decrease after unlearning (model \"forgets\" this data)\n",
        "2. **Retain Set Accuracy**: Should remain high (model maintains knowledge of retained data)\n",
        "3. **Test Set Accuracy**: Overall model performance indicator\n",
        "4. **Parameter Distance**: How much the model changed from original\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gaussian Noise**: Simple, uniform perturbation across all parameters. Easy to implement and tune.\n",
        "- **Laplacian Noise**: Better for differential privacy guarantees due to heavier tails. Provides formal privacy bounds.\n",
        "- **Adaptive Noise**: Targets important parameters (high gradients on forget set) more aggressively. Better trade-off between forgetting and retaining.\n",
        "- **Layer-wise Noise**: Allows fine-grained control per layer. Can focus noise on output layers that directly influence predictions.\n",
        "- **Gradient-based Noise**: Focuses on parameters most responsible for forget set. Noise magnitude scales with parameter importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Trade-offs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **More noise** → Better forgetting but worse retain/test performance\n",
        "- **Less noise** → Better retain/test performance but less effective forgetting\n",
        "- **Adaptive methods** → Better balance between forgetting and retaining\n",
        "- **Computational cost**: Gradient-based and adaptive methods require forward/backward pass on forget set\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start small**: Begin with small noise levels and increase gradually\n",
        "2. **Monitor both sets**: Track both forget and retain set performance\n",
        "3. **Use adaptive methods**: For better trade-offs, consider gradient-based or adaptive noise\n",
        "4. **Compare to baseline**: Always compare against retrain-from-scratch baseline\n",
        "5. **Consider privacy**: Use Laplacian noise if differential privacy guarantees are needed\n",
        "6. **Layer targeting**: Focus noise on later layers (closer to output) for more targeted forgetting\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Each Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gaussian Noise**: Quick experiments, baseline comparisons\n",
        "- **Laplacian Noise**: When differential privacy is required\n",
        "- **Adaptive Noise**: When you want to minimize impact on retained data\n",
        "- **Layer-wise Noise**: When you know which layers are most important\n",
        "- **Gradient-based Noise**: When you want targeted, efficient unlearning\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Noise-based methods are **approximate** - they don't guarantee complete removal of information\n",
        "2. May require careful tuning of noise levels\n",
        "3. Can degrade overall model performance\n",
        "4. No formal guarantees about what information is removed\n",
        "5. May not work well for very small forget sets or highly correlated data\n"
