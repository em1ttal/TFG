    "## 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is widely known for its dynamic computational graph and efficient tensor operations, making it a popular choice for both researchers and productions environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of PyTorch:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Computational Graph (Define-by-Run):** Unlike static frameworks, PyTorch allows you to define and modify the computational graph on the fly. This flexibility is beneficial for debugging and developing complex deep neural networks.\n",
    "- **Tensors and Autograd:** PyTorch provides a multidimensional array, called a Tensor, which can run on both CPUs and GPUs. The `autograd` module automates the computation of gradients, simplifying the backpropagation process for neural networks.\n",
    "- **NN Module:** PyTorch's `torch.nn` module makes it easy to build and train neural networks by making it convenient to abstract layers, loss functions, and optimizers.\n",
    "- **Optimized Performance:** Using PyTorch, users can take advantage of faster training time. This is possible due to hardware acceleration with GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, PyTorch strikes a balance between flexibility and ease of use, making it a preferred choice for many in the deep learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a neural network for a regression task using PyTorch. The dataset we'll be using is the [Student Performance (Multiple Linear Regression)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression) dataset by [Nikhil Narayan](https://www.kaggle.com/nikhil7280).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to predict the final grade of students based on the given features. Our aim is to minimize the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has the following features (as can be viewed in the dataset's data card):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hours Studied:** The total number of hours spent studying by each student.\n",
    "- **Previous Scores:** The scores obtained by students in previous tests.\n",
    "- **Extracurricular Activities:** Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes or No).\n",
    "- **Sleep Hours:** The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.\n",
    "- **Sample Question Papers Practiced:** The number of sample question papers the student practiced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is described as follows:\n",
    "- **Performance Index:** A measure of the overall performance of each student. The performance index represents the student's academic performance and has been rounded to the nearest integer. The index ranges from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always good to know your data well before starting model building and trying out your ideas. In order to keep this notebook focused only on the model building part, I will only do the bare minimum data preprocessing, and no exploratory data analysis."

    "    \n",
    "- **PyTorch:** We import `torch` and `torch.nn` modules to build our neural network and handle tensor operations. We also bring in `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader` from `torch.utils.data` to manage our dataset and create data loaders. \n",
    "- **Pandas and NumPy:** We import these libraries for dataset manipulation and numerical operations. `pandas` will be used to load the dataset which is in the form of a `csv` file in our case.\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn:** We import `train_test_split` to split our data into training and testing sets. We also bring in `mean_squared_error` to evaluate the performance of our regression model. `StandardScaler` class has been imported to scale the numerical features."

One-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category, ensuring that no ordinal relationships are implied between categories. This method can be used when a categorical feature has more than two possible values, helping the model to better interpret each distinct category without assuming any inherent order."

On the other hand, since the testing data loader is only for the calculation of test losses, shuffling isn't really necessary."

    "\n",
    "1. **Loss Function:** We use `nn.MSELoss()` as the loss function, as we want to minimize mean squared loss for this regression problem. Had the problem, been that of binary classfication, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()` would have been suitable. Furthermore, for multi-class classification problems, `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` would have been used.\n",

    "2. **Optimizer:** We use the Adam optimizer (`torch.optim.Adam`) in the training loop to update the parameters of the model. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (`torch.optim.SGD()`) is also another popular choice, though Adam is most widely used because it is reasonably faster than other alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Loop:**\n",
    "     - `model.train()` function ensures that the network's dropout layers and batch normalization layers (we don't have any of those in our architecture, but this is a good practice to keep in mind for complex architectures you are gonna be coding up more complex networks). In essence, `model.train()` and `model.eval()` are opposite in function to each other.\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. **Evaluation Loop:** \n",
    "    - After each epoch, the model is set to evaluation mode with `model.eval()`. `modeleval()` removes dropout and batch normalization layers from the network, as they are not needed during evaluation.\n",
    "    - We compute the test loss using `torch.inference_mode()` to avoid tracking gradients during evaluation.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",

    "It is not absolutely necessary to keep track of train and test losses as we have done here. But the reason for doing so is to plot the loss curves once the training is done.\n",
